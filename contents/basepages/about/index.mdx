Hello World, .

I'm Akwaugo Chidera Jade Dike, but friends call me Akwa, 

I dabbled in a few side gigs and had everchanging hobbies in my late teens. This took me on many different paths until i realised, whilst preparing a dish at work one day, that what i actually  wanted was to be part of the technology industry. So hear i am; a computer games development student trying to make a name for themselves, one project at a time

Born and bred in North East London, I took a shining to street art, music, and the good-time vibes that run through East London's veins. This has influenced my work and lifestyle, massively. I believe great tech should aid, entertain, and educate and that is exactly what I hope to create. finding the most interesting and current human experiences, then pairing them with technology would be my ideal kind of work. Although Iâ€™m currently working as a part-time chef whilst studying to fill in the gaps until then. 

My dream is to become a competent, full-stack developer so I can apply this to any project I or anyone can think of. Whether that be in developing video games for indie games' companies, an app for App stores, or developing robotics/AI systems. My journey has only just begun, but I'm super excited about the prospect of expanding my portfolio and my mind.
